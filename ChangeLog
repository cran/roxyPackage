ChangeLog for package roxyPackage

changes in version 0.03-6 (2013-04-07)
added:
  - debianize() now supports both strict package names according to the
    Debain R Policy as well as package names with a dot, whichever is expected by
    your r-cran.mk file. Ignoring the policy is the default, as that is the
    de-facto standard.

changes in version 0.03-5 (2013-03-30)
fixed:
  - .find.package() will soon be removed from R, replaced it with
    find.package() for R >= 2.13

changes in version 0.03-4 (2013-03-12)
changed:
  - internally replaced paste(..., sep="") with paste0(...), and added a
    version dependent wrapper for compatibility with R < 2.15
added:
  - AGPL and Artistic License 2.0 have been added to the common licenses
fixed:
  - license files are now called LICENSE.txt; this is to prevent their
    installation, as suggested by 'Writing R Extensions'

changes in version 0.03-3 (2013-02-13)
added:
  - extended sandboxing possibilities to archive.packages() and debianize()
changed:
  - sandbox() will now remove all paths set if "active" is FALSE

changes in version 0.03-2 (2013-02-11)
added:
  - new sandbox feature, see ?sandbox() and ?sandbox.status(). this needs
    testing, and future releases will get support for this in all relevant
    functions, not just roxy.package(), as it is now.

changes in version 0.03-1 (2013-01-29)
changed:
  - split documentation for ChangeLog functions and methods
added:
  - there is now an EXPERIMENTAL option to be able to toy around with
    roxygen3: call 'roxyPackage:::set.roxyEnv(name="roxygenVersion", value=3)' to
    enable some hidden features, i.e. use roxygen3::roxygenise() instead of
    roxygen2::roxygenize(). you need to install and load the roxygen3 package first
    -- temper with this at your own risk. please note: there will probably
    never be an official roxygen3 package on CRAN, and once its features were
    merged into roxygen2, this option might be patched out of roxyPackage again.
  - this is the first version of roxyPackage supposed to be released on CRAN

changes in version 0.02-23 (2013-01-25)
changed:
  - updated vignette
fixed:
  - debian installation notes will not be linked from a package's HTML page
    if there is no built debian package in the repository

changes in version 0.02-22 (2012-10-30)
changed:
  - the title for *-package.R files now states "The <package name> Package"
    instead of the Title: entry from the description
fixed:
  - order of ChangeLog entries is now checked, so that the newest entries get
    on top

changes in version 0.02-21 (2012-10-14)
added:
  - new action "log" generates an initial ChangeLog, if none is found
  - introducing new functions initChangeLog(), readChangeLog(),
    writeChangeLog(), as well as the methods getChangeLogEntry() and updateChangeLog().
    they are probably not bug-free, but should ease the management of proper R
    ChangeLogs considerably.
changed:
  - this ChangeLog was read-in by readChangeLog(), updated with the log
    entries for this release by updateChangeLog(), and written back with
    writeChangeLog().

changes in version 0.02-20 (2012-09-29)
fixed:
  - contributors in Author@R/Authors@R fields are now also added to
    *-package.R and DESCRIPTION
  - the "check" option "--as-cran" is automatically stripped for R < 2.15

changes in version 0.02-19 (2012-09-09)
changed:
  - the "check" action now has "--as-cran" set as the default option
added:
  - the "doc" action now also supports "vignette" subdirectories in addition
    to "inst/doc" for vignette files
  - added new function archive.packages() to move old versions of packages to
    an archive directory, or to remove them for good. since this is
    potentially dangerous and needs some rounds of testing, its "reallyDoIt"-option
    needs to be set to TRUE manually, otherwise a dry run is done, i.e., all
    actions are only printed and not done, so you can check the outcome first.

changes in version 0.02-18 (2012-07-30)
fixed:
  - using shortPathName() to fix problems on windows caused by the path
    normalization introduced with 0.02-17 (thanks to henrik singmann for tracking
    this one down)
changed:
  - wrote some new internal helper functions, namely createMissingDir() and
    removeIfExists(), and replaced their manual pendants in the roxy.package()
    code, which is now easier to read

changes in version 0.02-17 (2012-07-20)
fixed:
  - the tar option "--exclude-vcs" is not always implemented, especially not
    in the BSD tar of Mac OS X; so excluding version control directories is
    now done in a more manual manner in roxyPackage
  - also, on Mac OS X the tar binary is now identified using Sys.which("tar")
  - finally, "--exclude=*~" caused trouble if path names contained a tilde
    for $HOME, so this was replaced with a more reliable way to exclude backup~
    files as well
  - all root paths are now normalized before first use, especially to perform
    tilde expansion, because this lead to errors with tar()

changes in version 0.02-16 (2012-07-12)
fixed:
  - HTML generation now also works if there's no "Author:" field in the
    DESCRIPTION

changes in version 0.02-15 (2012-06-10)
changed:
  - the data.frame with the package description doesn't need to have entries
    for "Author" or "Maintainer" any more, as long as "Authors@R" is present

changes in version 0.02-14 (2012-06-05)
fixed:
  - roxyPackage now supports multiple vignette files in one package
  - fixed problems if the repository isn't on the same file system as the
    sources

changes in version 0.02-13 (2012-05-12)
fixed:
  - fixed malformed BibTeX entry in CITATION if more than one author given

changes in version 0.02-12 (2012-05-11)
fixed:
  - line breaks were missing in repo HTML, which lead to malformed <pre>
    sections
  - debian repo information will now generally be prepared for binary and
    source packages

changes in version 0.02-11 (2012-04-29)
added:
  - added a vignette
  - debianize() now creates debian/compat, by default set to level 7
changed:
  - status messages are more consistent now
  - the link to a debian binary package moved from the general package HTML
    page to the debian repository info page

changes in version 0.02-10 (2012-04-19)
added:
  - debianize() now checks if a given GnuPG key is already available as a
    file in the repository, and if not, saves is as <key ID>.asc
  - the "html" action now also adds auto-generated information on how to
    install debian packages from the maintained repository

changes in version 0.02-9 (2012-04-15)
added:
  - this is the first package, along with its dependecies, which is also
    available as a debian package build with roxyPackage
changed:
  - if information is to be fetched from a DESCRIPTION file and there is no
    "Date" field, roxy.package() considers "Packaged" and then
    "Date/Publication" as fallback alternatives (and throws a warning)
  - the actions "deb", "roxy", "cite", "license", "doc", "cl2news" and
    "news2rss" are now only run once for builds against multiple R installations,
    because their outcome should be the same anyway
fixed:
  - 'deb.options' are now also passed to recursive calls of roxy.package(),
    although there's still no solution for actual builds against multiple R
    installations

changes in version 0.02-8 (2012-04-14)
added:
  - roxy.package() now checks for needed fields in DESCRIPTION, if that file
    is used to get info on the package, and throws an error if something is
    missing
  - installation now includes common-licenses.zip
  - roxy.package() has a new action "license" to detect the package license
    and save a copy of common free software licenses as the package's LICENSE
    file

fixed:
  - regex to get author info without e-mail address for debian/copyright now
    works with multiple authors

added:
  - debianize() can now sign Release files with GnuPG
  - roxy.package() has a new action "deb" and a new parameter 'deb.options',
    to invoke debianize() directly

changed:
  - Release files in debianize() are now generated with apt-ftparchive
  - debianize() talks a little more about what it's busy with
  - debian package dependencies now detect R version for "r-base" and
    "r-base-dev"
fixed:
  - debian package dependencies now default to "r-base" instead of
    "r-base-dev"

changes in version 0.02-6 (2012-04-10)
added:
  - initial (and rather experimental...) support for debianizing packages
    with the debianize() function
changed:

    news2rss()

    feeds
fixed:

changes in version 0.02-1 (2012-03-14)
  - added new function news2rss() to write RSS feeds (XML) from
    NEWS.Rd/NEWS.html files
  - action "html" now adds the RSS feed for a package to the HTML header and
    news link
  - exported a new function, cl2news(), which now carries out the action by
    the same name, but can also used stand-alone

changes in version 0.01-18 (2012-02-09)
